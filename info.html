                <h3>What Causes Depression</h3>
                <p>There are many factors that are responsible for depression.</p>
                <p>There is social media which causes people to compare their lives with others when they do not meet societal standard.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Childhood trauma can be a factor. Some people had to suffer from abuse, molestation and even bullying. These can lead to low self-esteem and feel unworthy of care and love.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It could also be past bad experiences that blocks people from moving forward in fear of rejection and constant feelings of guilt.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The symptoms of depression include inability to concentrate, feelings of guilt because depression begins with you blaming yourself for all the things going wrong in your life and the world in general; fatigue, unintentional weight loss / low appetite, insomnia/hypersomnia and recurrent thoughts of death.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is no one way to cure depression. One must be willing to ask for help to get help. There are a lot of professionals out there who can provide the tools to betterment. Available support groups can also encourage people and let them know that they are not alone. </p>
                <br>
